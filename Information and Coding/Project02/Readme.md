All of the Codecs, Bitstream and Golomb classes, as well as their testing programs have been writte using C++.

Python is used on exercise 2 in PartB as a way to create the histogram images, since it's a simpler implementation. 

## Running

All directories have an example file containing a simple g++ config to run the program.

Example:
```bash
g++ testImageCodec.cpp ../../PartA/1/bitstream.cpp ../../PartA/3/Golomb.cpp ../1/ImageCodec.cpp -lX11 -lpthread -o lossyimage
```
